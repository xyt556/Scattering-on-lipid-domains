 abstract = {The chemical diversity of lipids and their complex arrangements in
supramolecular assemblies are in stark contrast to our previous notions
of them as passive structural components. For example, in plasma
membranes, sphingolipids are primarily located in the outer monolayer,
whereas unsaturated phospholipids are more abundant in the inner
leaflet. Our recent results offer a direct contribution to the importance
of lipid diversity in biological membranes. We have studied the location
of cholesterol within polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) bilayers
doped with different amounts of monounsaturated (POPC) or disaturated
(DMPC) lipids. Using deuterium labeling and neutron diffraction,
we have found that in PUFA bilayers, cholesterol can be flipped from
its known position in the bilayer center to its commonly assumed
upright orientation simply by varying the amount of POPC. Although
it takes 50 mol {\%} POPC to flip cholesterol in PUFA bilayers, the
same effect is achieved with only 5 mol {\%} DMPC, elegantly emphasizing
cholesterol's affinity for saturated chains. It also suggests that
the presence of PUFA in the inner leaflet of a cellular bilayer may
enhance the transfer of cholesterol to the outer layer, potentially
modifying raft composition and the local function of a membrane.},

 abstract = {A new method for analysis of scattering data from lamellar bilayer systems is presented. The method employs a form-free description of the cross-section structure of the bilayer and the fit is performed directly to the scattering data, introducing also a structure factor when required. The cross-section structure (electron density profile in the case of X-ray scattering) is described by a set of Gaussian functions and the technique is termed Gaussian deconvolution. The coefficients of the Gaussians are optimized using a constrained least-squares routine that induces smoothness of the electron density profile. The optimization is coupled with the point-of-inflection method for determining the optimal weight of the smoothness. With the new approach, it is possible to optimize simultaneously the form factor, structure factor and several other parameters in the model. The applicability of this method is demonstrated by using it in a study of a multilamellar system composed of lecithin bilayers, where the form factor and structure factor are obtained simultaneously, and the obtained results provided new insight into this very well known system.},

 abstract = {We present a method for analyzing small angle x-ray scattering data on multilamellar phospholipid bilayer systems at full hydration. The method utilizes a modified Caille theory structure factor in combination with a Gaussian model representation of the electron density profile such that it accounts also for the diffuse scattering between Bragg peaks. Thus the method can retrieve structural information even if only a few orders of diffraction are observed. We further introduce a procedure to derive fundamental parameters, such as area per lipid, membrane thickness, and number of water molecules per lipid, directly from the electron density profile without the need of additional volumetric measurements. The theoretical apparatus is applied to experimental data on 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and 1, 2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine liposome preparations},

 abstract = {Phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids play essential roles in biological processes, including enzyme activation and apoptosis. We report on the molecular structure and atomic scale interactions of a fluid bilayer composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine (POPS). A scattering density profile model, aided by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, was developed to jointly refine different contrast small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering data, which yielded a lipid area of 62.7 {\AA}(2) at 25 °C. MD simulations with POPS lipid area constrained at different values were also performed using all-atom and aliphatic united-atom models. The optimal simulated bilayer was obtained using a model-free comparison approach. Examination of the simulated bilayer, which agrees best with the experimental scattering data, reveals a preferential interaction between Na(+) ions and the terminal serine and phosphate moieties. Long-range inter-lipid interactions were identified, primarily between the positively charged ammonium, and the negatively charged carboxylic and phosphate oxygens. The area compressibility modulus KA of the POPS bilayer was derived by quantifying lipid area as a function of surface tension from area-constrained MD simulations. It was found that POPS bilayers possess a much larger KA than that of neutral phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers. We propose that the unique molecular features of POPS bilayers may play an important role in certain physiological functions.},

@article{Pan.2015,
 abstract = {The detailed structural and mechanical properties of a tetraoleoyl cardiolipin (TOCL) bilayer were determined using neutron spin echo (NSE) spectroscopy, small angle neutron and X-ray scattering (SANS and SAXS, respectively), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We used MD simulations to develop a scattering density profile (SDP) model, which was then utilized to jointly refine SANS and SAXS data. In addition to commonly reported lipid bilayer structural parameters, component distributions were obtained, including the volume probability, electron density and neutron scattering length density. Of note, the distance between electron density maxima DHH (39.4 {\AA}) and the hydrocarbon chain thickness 2DC (29.1 {\AA}) of TOCL bilayers were both found to be larger than the corresponding values for dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers. Conversely, TOCL bilayers have a smaller overall bilayer thickness DB (36.7 {\AA}), primarily due to their smaller headgroup volume per phosphate. SDP analysis yielded a lipid area of 129.8 {\AA}(2), indicating that the cross-sectional area per oleoyl chain in TOCL bilayers (i.e., 32.5 {\AA}(2)) is smaller than that for DOPC bilayers. Multiple sets of MD simulations were performed with the lipid area constrained at different values. The calculated surface tension versus lipid area resulted in a lateral area compressibility modulus KA of 342 mN m(-1), which is slightly larger compared to DOPC bilayers. Model free comparison to experimental scattering data revealed the best simulated TOCL bilayer from which detailed molecular interactions were determined. Specifically, Na(+) cations were found to interact most strongly with the glycerol hydroxyl linkage, followed by the phosphate and backbone carbonyl oxygens. Inter- and intra-lipid interactions were facilitated by hydrogen bonding between the glycerol hydroxyl and phosphate oxygen, but not with the backbone carbonyl. Finally, analysis of the intermediate scattering functions from NSE spectroscopy measurements of TOCL bilayers yielded a bending modulus KC of 1.06 $\times$ 10(-19) J, which was larger than that observed in DOPC bilayers. Our results show the physicochemical properties of cardiolin bilayers that may be important in explaining their functionality in the inner mitochondrial membrane.},

 abstract = {The effects of cholesterol on membrane bending modulus K-C, membrane
thickness D-HH, the partial and apparent areas of cholesterol and
lipid, and the order parameter S-xray are shown to depend upon the
number of saturated hydrocarbon chains in the lipid molecules. Particularly
striking is the result that up to 40{\%} cholesterol does not increase
the bending modulus K-C of membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine
lipids with two cis monounsaturated chains, although it does have
the expected stiffening effect on membranes composed of lipids with
two saturated chains. The B fluctuational modulus in the smectic
liquid crystal theory is obtained and used to discuss the interactions
between bilayers. Our K-C results motivate a theory of elastic moduli
in the high cholesterol limit and they challenge the relevance of
universality concepts. Although most of our results were obtained
at 30 degrees C, additional data at other temperatures to allow consideration
of a reduced temperature variable do not support universality for
the effect of cholesterol on all lipid bilayers. If the concept of
universality is to be valid, different numbers of saturated chains
must be considered to create different universality classes. The
above experimental results were obtained from analysis of x-ray scattering
in the low angle and wide angle regions.},

@article{Papanikolaou.2005,
 abstract = {CD39 ( ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase1; E-NTPDase1)
is a plasma membrane ecto-enzyme that regulates purinergic receptor
signaling by controlling the levels of extracellular nucleotides.
In blood vessels this enzyme exhibits a thromboregulatory role through
the control of platelet aggregation. CD39 is localized in caveolae,
which are plasma membrane invaginations with distinct lipid composition,
similar to dynamic lipid microdomains, called rafts. Cholesterol
is enriched together with sphingolipids in both rafts and caveolae,
as well as in other specialized domains of the membrane, and plays
a key role in their function. Here, we examine the potential role
of cholesterol-enriched domains in CD39 function. Using polarized
Madin-Darby canine kidney ( MDCK) cells and caveolin-1 gene-disrupted
mice, we show that caveolae are not essential either for the enzymatic
activity of CD39 or for its targeting to plasma membrane. On the
other hand, flotation experiments using detergent-free or detergent-based
approaches indicate that CD39 associates, at least in part, with
distinct lipid assemblies. In the apical membrane of MDCK cells,
which lacks caveolae, CD39 is localized in microvilli, which are
also cholesterol and raft-dependent membrane domains. Interfering
with cholesterol levels using drugs that either deplete or sequester
membrane cholesterol results in a strong inhibition of the enzymatic
and anti-platelet activity of CD39. The effects of cholesterol depletion
are completely reversed by replenishment of membranes with pure cholesterol,
but not by cholestenone. These data suggest a functional link between
the localization of CD39 in cholesterol-rich domains of the membrane
and its role in thromboregulation.},

@article{Pare.1998,
 abstract = {It is well established that cholesterol induces the formation of
a liquid-ordered phase in phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers. The
goal of this work is to examine the influence of cholesterol on phosphatidylethanolamine
polymorphism. The behavior of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanol
(POPE)/cholesterol mixtures was characterized using infrared and
H-2 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (using POPE bearing
a perdeuterated palmitoyl chain in the latter case). Our results
reveal that cholesterol induces the formation of a liquid-ordered
phase in POPE membranes, similar to those observed for various PC/cholesterol
systems. However, the coexistence region of the gel and the liquid-ordered
phases is different from that proposed for PC/cholesterol systems.
The results indicate a progressive broadening of the gel-to-fluid
phase transition, suggesting the absence of an eutectic. In addition,
there is a progressive downshift of the end of the transition for
cholesterol content higher than 10 mol {\%}. Cholesterol has an ordering
effect on the acyl chains of POPE, but it is less pronounced than
for the PC equivalent. This study also shows that the cholesterol
effect on the lamellar-to-hexagonal (L-alpha-H-II) phase transition
is not monotonous. It shifts the transition toward the low temperatures
between 0 and 30 mol {\%} cholesterol but shifts it toward the high
temperatures when cholesterol content is higher than 30 mol {\%}. The
change in conformational order of the lipid acyl chains, as probed
by the shift of the symmetric methylene C-H stretching, shows concerted
variations. Finally, we show that cholesterol maintains its chain
ordering effect in the hexagonal phase.},

((LA)(12)) on the thermotropic phase behavior of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-d(62)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine

calorimetry (DSC) and the conformational and orientational order
of the phospholipid chains by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy

Our DSC and FTIR spectroscopic studies indicate that the peptides
L-24 and (LA)(12) both decrease the temperature and enthalpy of the
gel/liquid-crystalline phase transition of DPPC-d(62) bilayers, with
(LA)(12) having the greater effect in this regard. An examination
of the frequencies of the CH2 and CD2 symmetric stretching bands
of the infrared spectra of liquid-crystalline states of the peptide-free
and peptide-containing DPPC-d(62) and POPC-d(31) samples, and a comparison
with the orientational order as measured by H-2-NMR spectroscopy
as well as with the chain order as measured by electron spin resonance
spectroscopy, lead us to conclude that the CH2 (or CD2) stretching
frequencies of lipid hydrocarbon chains are not a reliable measure
of chain conformational order in lipid bilayers containing significant
amounts of peptides or other lipophilic inclusions. In contrast,
the results of our H-2-NMR spectroscopic studies present a consistent
picture in which both L-24 and (LA)(12) increased in a similar way
the time-averaged orientational order of the lipid chains of their
liquid-crystalline lipid bilayer hosts. The comparison of the effects
L-24 and (LA)(12) On phosphatidylcholine bilayers indicates that
the gel-to-liquid-crystalline phase transition appears to be more
sensitive to small changes in transmembrane peptide surface topology
than hydrocarbon carbon chain orientational order in the liquid-crystalline
state. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Lipid rafts are fluctuating nanoscale assemblies of sphingolipid, cholesterol, and proteins that can be stabilized to coalesce, forming platforms that function in membrane signaling and trafficking.

for eight C-D bonds of cholesterol. Due to the new precision of the
experimental data, the original analysis by Dufourc et al. (1984.

a systematic study of the influence on the precision and uniqueness

x-ray, neutron scattering, or force field-minimized structures, (ii)
internal mobility, (iii) the axial symmetry hypothesis, and (iv)
the knowledge of some quadrupolar splitting assignments. Good agreement
between experiment and theory could be obtained only with the neutron
scattering structure, for which both axial symmetry hypothesis and
full order parameter matrix analysis gave satisfactory results. Finally,
this work revealed an average orientation of cholesterol slightly
different from those previously published and, most importantly,
a molecular order parameter equal to 0.95 +/- 0.01, instead of 0.79
+/- 0.03 previously found for the same system at 30 degrees C. Temperature

 abstract = {Lipid-protein interactions are an important determinant of the stability and function of integral and transmembrane proteins. In addition to local interactions at the lipid-protein interface, global interactions such as the distribution of internal lateral pressure may also influence protein conformation. It is shown here that the effects of the membrane lateral pressure profile on the conformation or insertion of proteins in membranes (Cantor, R. S., J. Phys. Chem. B 101, 1723-1725, 1997) are equivalent to the elastic response to the frustrated spontaneous curvature, co, of the component lipid monolayer leaflets. The chemical potential of the protein in the membrane is predicted to depend linearly on the spontaneous curvature of the lipid leaflets, just as does the contribution of the protein to the elastic bending energy of the lipid, and to be independent of the hydrophobic tension, gammaphob, at the lipid-water interface. Analysis of the dependence of protein partitioning or conformational transitions on spontaneous curvature of the constituent lipids gives an experimental estimate for the cross-sectional intramembrane shape of the protein or its diff 50-110 A(2) are estimated for the effective cross-sectional shape changes on the insertion and conductance transitions of alamethicin, and on the activation of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase or rhodopsin in lipid membranes. Much larger values are estimated for the mechanosensitive channel, MscL. Values for the change in intramembrane shape may also be used, together with determinations of lipid relative association constants, to estimate contributions of direct lipid-protein interactions to the lateral pressure experienced by the protein. Changes in chemical potential ~ 12 kJ.mol(-1) can be estimated for radial changes of 1 A in a protein of diameter 40 A},

 abstract = {Lipid chain length modulates the activity of transmembrane proteins by mismatch between the hydrophobic span of the protein and that of the lipid membrane. Relative binding affinities of lipids with different chain lengths are used to estimate the excess free energy of lipid-protein interaction that arises from hydrophobic mismatch. For a wide range of integral proteins and peptides, the energy cost is much less than the elastic penalty of fully stretching or compressing the lipid chains to achieve complete hydrophobic matching. The chain length dependences of the free energies of lipid association are described by a model that combines elastic chain extension with a free energy term that depends linearly on the extent of residual mismatch. The excess free energy densities involved lie in the region of 0.5-2.0 k(B)T x nm(-2). Values of this size could arise from exposure of hydrophobic groups to polar portions of the lipid or protein, but not directly to water, or alternatively from changes in tilt of the transmembrane helices that are energetically comparable to those activating mechanosensitive channels. The influence of hydrophobic mismatch on dimerization of transmembrane helices and their transfer between lipid vesicles, and on shifts in chain-melting transitions of lipid bilayers by incorporated proteins, is analyzed by using the same thermodynamic model. Segmental order parameters confirm that elastic lipid chain distortions are insufficient to compensate fully for the mismatch, but the dependence on chain length with tryptophan-anchored peptides requires that the free energy density of hydrophobic mismatch should increase with increasing extent of mismatch},

Although the crucial feature is the coexistence of phase-separated fluid domains, direct evidence for this in mixtures of cholesterol with a single lipid is extremely sparse. More extensive evidence comes from ternary mixtures of a high chain-melting lipid and a low chain-melting lipid with cholesterol, including those containing sphingomyelin that are taken to be a raft paradigm. There is, however, not complete agreement between the various phase diagrams and their interpretation. In this review, the different ternary phase diagrams of cholesterol-containing systems are presented in a uniform way, using simple x,y-coordinates to increase accessibility for the non-specialist. It is then possible to appreciate the common features and examine critically the discrepancies and hence what direct biophysical evidence there is that supports the raft concept},

@article{McIntosh.1993,
 abstract = {The total repulsive interaction between electrically neutral, fluid bilayer membranes is thought to have a number of components, including a hydration pressure, due to the reorientation of water by the bilayer, and steric (entropic) pressures due to bilayer undulations, head group motion, and molecular protrusions. For fully hydrated, crystalline bilayers these three steric pressures should be relatively small, and the major repulsive pressure present should be the hydration pressure. Therefore, to isolate the contribution of hydration pressure to the total interbilayer interaction, we have measured pressure-distance data by X-ray diffraction analysis of osmotically stressed dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) multilayers in the subgel phase, where wide-angle and low-angle X-ray data show the bilayers are crystalline. As applied pressure was increased from 0 to 1 x 10(6) dyn/cm2, the interbilayer fluid space (df) decreased less than 1 A from its value at full hydration of 8.4 A. As the pressure was increased from 1 x 10(6) to 3 x 10(7) dyn/cm2, df decreased from about 8 to 4 A. For this range of df, the repulsive pressure decayed exponentially with df with a decay length of 1.4 A. Further increases in applied pressure did not appreciably decrease df, so that there was a sharp upward break in the pressure-distance curve at an interbilayer spacing of about 3 A. In contrast, pressure-distance relations for gel (L beta') phase and liquid-crystalline (L alpha) phase bilayers had much softer upward breaks at df < 5 A and extended to larger df at zero applied pressure. However, the pressure-distance curves for all three phases decayed exponentially with approximately the same decay length for 4 < df < 8 A. We interpret these data to mean the following: (1) the repulsion observed for df < 5 A is primarily a steric pressure whose range depends on head group motion; (2) the steric undulation pressure plays an important role in determining the hydration properties and the range of the total repulsive pressure for fluid membranes; (3) the same underlying mechanisms govern the repulsive pressure for all phases for 4 < df < 8 A; (4) these mechanisms include a pressure due to reorientation of water molecules; and (5) the hydration pressure component extents a maximum of about two water molecules from the bilayer surface for the subgel phase},

The addition of 40{\%} cholesterol to either DOPC or DPPC changes the WAXS pattern due to an increase in acyl chain orientational order, which is one of the main properties distinguishing the cholesterol-rich liquid-ordered (Lo) phase from the liquid-disordered (Ld) phase. In contrast, powder x-ray data from multilamellar vesicles does not yield information about orientational order, and the scattering from the Lo and Ld phases looks similar. An analytical model to describe the relationship between the chain orientational distribution and WAXS data was used to obtain an average orientational order parameter, S(x-ray). When 40{\%} cholesterol is added to either DOPC or DPPC, S(x-ray) more than doubles, consistent with previous NMR order parameter measurements. By combining information about the average chain orientation with the chain-chain correlation spacing, we extended a commonly used method for calculating areas for gel-phase lipids to fluid-phase lipids and obtained agreement to within 5{\%} of literature values},

Using the method of analysis developed in the accompanying work, we find that two orientational distributions are necessary to fit the WAXS data at lower temperatures, whereas only one distribution is needed at temperatures higher than the miscibility transition temperature, T(mix) = 25-35 degrees C (for 1:1 DOPC/DPPC with 15{\%}, 20{\%}, 25{\%}, and 30{\%} Chol). We propose that the necessity for two distributions is a criterion for coexistence of Lo domains with a high S(x-ray) order parameter and Ld domains with a lower order parameter. This criterion is capable of detecting coexistence of small domains or rafts that the conventional x-ray criterion of two lamellar D spacings may not. Our T(mix) values tend to be slightly larger than published NMR results and microscopy results when the fluorescence probe artifact is considered. This is consistent with the sensitivity of WAXS to very short time and length scales, which makes it more capable of detecting small, short-lived domains that are likely close to T(mix)},

 abstract = {The fundamental issue of interactions between lipid bilayers is addressed experimentally and theoretically. We report high- resolution x-ray scattering data for bilayers composed of three different kinds of phosphatidylcholine lipids. These data yield the interbilayer water spacing fluctuation a, as well as the traditional osmotic pressure P, both as functions of the lamellar repeat spacing D and the aqueous separation a. We show theoretically how to obtain the functional form of the fluctuational free energy from the sigma data, which is then determined to within a factor that depends upon the bending modulus, K-c. The resulting functional form determined from experimental data has an exponential decay rather than the power law decay that applies for hard confinement in the large a regime, thereby showing that a theory of soft confinement is necessary. However, the existing theory of soft confinement predicts an exponential decay, but with a smaller decay length lambda(fl) than we obtain. We then use these results to analyze the osmotic pressure data in terms of the bending modulus K-c and the interbilayer interactions consisting of van der Waals and hydration interactions. For all three chemically different lipids we find that the decay length lambda of the hydration pressure is 1.9 -2.0 Angstrom; the Hamaker parameter for the van der Waals interaction is about 5 x 10(-14) erg if the bending moduli K-c are chosen to be different for the three lipids and in the range (0.5-0.8) x 10(-12) erg},

@article{Tayebi.2012,
 abstract = {Liquid-crystalline phases of stacked lipid bilayers represent a pervasive motif in biomolecular assemblies. Here we report that, in addition to the usual smectic order, multicomponent multilayer membranes can exhibit columnar order arising from the coupling of two-dimensional intralayer phase separation and interlayer smectic ordering. This coupling propagates across hundreds of membrane lamellae, producing long-range alignment of phase-separated domains. Quantitative analysis of real-time dynamical experiments reveals that there is an interplay between intralayer domain growth and interlayer coupling, suggesting the existence of cooperative multilayer epitaxy. We postulate that such long-range epitaxy is solvent-assisted, and that it originates from the surface tension associated with differences in the network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules at the hydrated interfaces between the domains and the surrounding phase. Our findings might inspire the development of self-assembly-based strategies for the long-range alignment of functional lipid domains.},

to study the effect of ethanol on the molecular structure and dynamics
of lipid membranes. 1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3phoshatidylcholine
(DMPC) powder hydrated with a 5 wt{\%} ethanol solution (corresponding
to 2 mol{\%} of ethanol) was used in this study. From high-resolution
X-ray experiments the position and partitioning of the ethanol molecules
in the phospholipid bilayers was determined in their gel and fluid
phases. We find that the ethanol molecules reside in the head group
region of the bilayers, with 1.6 ethanol molecules per lipid molecule
in the gel phase and 1.2 ethanol molecules per lipid molecule in
the fluid phase. We find evidence for enhanced permeability in both
fluid and gel phases of the phospholipid bilayers in the presence
of ethanol molecules. Elastic and quasi-elastic neutron scattering
data, obtained using a neutron backscattering spectrometer, was used
to study slow, nanosecond molecular dynamics on length scales corresponding
to lipid diffusion, acyl chain dynamics and solvent dynamics. While
the presence of ethanol molecules had no observable effect on these
types of dynamics in the fluid (L-alpha) phase, the membranes appeared
to have a higher degree of order in gel (L-beta) and ripple (P-beta')
phases. In particular, lipid diffusion was found to be slower by
a factor of two in the more rigid gel phase when ethanol was present.},

@article{Trouard.1999,
 abstract = {Investigation of the deuterium (H-2) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
relaxation rates of lipid bilayers containing cholesterol can yield
new insights regarding its role in membrane function and dynamics.
Spin-lattice (R-1Z) and quadrupolar order (R-1Q) H-2 NMR relaxation
rates were measured at 46.1 and 76.8 MHz for macroscopically oriented
bilayers of 1,2-diperdeuteriomyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DMPC-d(54)) containing cholesterol (1/1 molar ratio) in the liquid-ordered
phase at 40 degrees C. The data for various segmental positions along
the DMPC-d(54) acyl chain were simultaneously fitted to a composite
membrane deformation model, including fast segmental motions which
preaverage the coupling tensor along the lipid acyl chain, slow molecular
reorientations, and small-amplitude collective fluctuations. In contrast
to pure DMPC-d(54) in the liquid-crystalline (L-alpha) phase, for
the DMPC-d(54): cholesterol (1/1) system a linear square-law functional
dependence of the relaxation rates on the order parameter (quadrupolar
splitting) does not appear evident. Moreover, for acyl segments closer
to the top of the chain, the angular anisotropy of the H-2 R-1Z and
R-1Q relaxation rates is more pronounced than toward the chain terminus.
The residual (preaveraged) coupling tensor has its greatest effective
asymmetry parameter near the polar groups, decreasing for the groups
closest to the end of the chain. The results suggest that axial rotations
of the phospholipid molecules occur at a somewhat higher rate than
in pure bilayers, as a consequence of the higher ordering and reduction
of chain entanglement. On the other hand, the rigid cholesterol molecule
appears to undergo somewhat slower axial rotation, possibly due to
its noncylindrical shape. Collective motions are found to be less
predominant in the case of DMPC-d(54): cholesterol than for pure
DMPC-d(54), which may indicate an increased dynamical rigidity of
lipid bilayers containing cholesterol versus pure lipid systems.

 abstract = {We investigated the application of inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) to lipid bilayers. This technique directly measures the dynamic structure factor S(q,omega) which is the space-time Fourier transform of the electron density correlation function of the measured system. For a multiatomic system, the analysis of S(q,omega) is usually complicated. But for multiple bilayers of lipid, S(q,omega) is dominated by chain-chain correlations within individual bilayers. Thus IXS provides a unique probe for the collective dynamics of lipid chains in a bilayer that cannot be obtained by any other method. IXS of dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine and dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine + cholesterol at two different concentrations were measured. S(q,omega) was analyzed by three-mode hydrodynamic equations, including a thermal diffusive mode and two propagating acoustic modes. We obtained the dispersion curves for the phonons that represent the collective in-plane excitations of lipid chains. The effect of cholesterol on chain dynamics was detected. Our analysis shows the importance of having a high instrument resolution as well as the requirement of sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to obtain meaningful results from such an IXS experiment. The requirement on signal-to-noise also applies to molecular dynamics simulations},

@article{Williams.2012,
 abstract = {Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), enriched in fish
oils, are increasingly recognized to have potential benefits for
treating many human afflictions. Despite the importance of PUFA,
their molecular mechanism of action remains unclear. One emerging
hypothesis is that phospholipids containing n-3 PUFA acyl chains
modify the structure and composition of membrane rafts, thus affecting
cell signaling. In this study the two major n-3 PUFA found in fish
oils, eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids, are
compared. Using solid-state H-2 NMR spectroscopy we explored the
molecular organization of 1-[H-2(31)]palmitoyl-2-eicosapentaenoylphosphatidylcholine
(PEPC-d(31)) and 1-[H-2(31)] palmitoyl-2-docosahexaenoylphosphatidylcholine
(PDPC-d(31)) in mixtures with sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol
(chol). Our results indicate that whereas both PEPC-d(31) and PDPC-d(31)
can accumulate into SM-rich/chol-rich raftlike domains, the tendency
for DHA to incorporate into rafts is more than twice as great as
for EPA. We propose that DHA may be the more bioactive component
of fish oil that serves to disrupt lipid raft domain organization.
This mechanism represents an evolution in the view of how PUFA remodel
membrane architecture.},

of main phase transition of liposomes including phase transition
temperature (onset temperature and peak temperature) and phase transition
cooperativity. The results showed that paeonol could incorporate

temperature of DPPC. Though stigmasterol interacts with DPPC less
favorably than cholesterol, thermotropic phase behavior of paeonol/cholesterol/DPPC
liposomes and that of paeonol/stigmasterol/DPPC liposomes are very
similar. A phase separation occurred when the molar ratio of paeonol
to sterol reached 1:1 in paeonol-encapsulated liposomes, where a
paeonol-rich domain coexisted with a sterol-rich domain. The packing
order of acyl chains of DPPC in sterol-rich domain is a little higher

recently been introduced as new cholesterol probe with superior fluorescence

(DHE), a well-established marker for cholesterol, by introducing
simultaneous imaging of both sterols in model membranes and living
cells. BCh2 had a lower affinity than DHE for the biologically relevant
liquid-ordered phase in model membranes. Still, DHE and BCh2 trafficked
from the plasma membrane to the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC)
of BHK cells with identical kinetics. This transport pathway was
strongly reduced after energy depletion of cells or expression of
the dominant-negative clathrin heavy chain. The partitioning into
lipid droplets of BHK and HeLa cells was higher for BCh2 than for
DHE. Within droplets, the photodegradation of BCh2 was enhanced and
followed a stretched exponential decay, while the fluorescence lifetime
of BCh2 was comparable in various cellular regions. Our results indicate
that BCh2 is suitable for analyzing sterol uptake pathways and inter-organelle
sterol flux in living cells. The BODIPY-moiety affects lipid phase

 abstract = {Dipole potential is the potential difference within the membrane bilayer,
which originates due to the nonrandom arrangement of lipid dipoles

sterol in higher eukaryotic membranes, is known to increase membrane
dipole potential. In this work, we explored the effects of immediate
(7-DHC and desmosterol) and evolutionary (ergosterol) precursors
of cholesterol on membrane dipole potential, monitored by the dual
wavelength ratiometric approach utilizing the probe di-8-ANEPPS.
Our results show that the effect of these precursors on membrane
dipole potential is very different from that observed with cholesterol,
although the structural differences among them are subtle. These
results assume relevance, since accumulation of cholesterol precursors
due to defective cholesterol biosynthesis has been reported to result
in several inherited metabolic disorders such as the Smith-Lemli-Opitz
syndrome. Interestingly, cholesterol (and its precursors) has a negligible
effect on dipole potential in polyunsaturated membranes. We interpret
these results in terms of noncanonical orientation of cholesterol
in these membranes. Our results constitute the first report on the
effect of biosynthetic and evolutionary precursors of cholesterol
on dipole potential, and imply that a subtle change in sterol structure
can significantly alter the dipolar field at the membrane interface.},

Bilayer membranes under progressive confinement experience a continual damping of undulatory fluctuations, first interpreted as a steric force (Helfrich. Z. Naturforsch. 1978). This paper uses a new, diffusion-equation formalism based on the Feynman-type variational principle to describe how direct interbilayer forces-of hydration, electrostatic double layers, and van der Waals attraction- confine membrane fluctuations. We recover theoretical results to examine measured forces in multilamellar arrays showing that {\dq}soft{\dq} collisions, through long-range forces, create a mutual enhancement of both the direct forces and the undulatory steric interactions. Thus, there is yet another way to resolve the old, but false, dilemma to choose between steric and direct forces driving membrane assembly. One may develop a systematic connection between bilayer charge, hydration, and flexibility and the action of configurational entropic forces. The results make clear that one should measure forces between membranes or macromolecules in a way that allows them to express their native mechanical freedom},

 abstract = {Isoflurane is an inhalational general anesthetic widely used in surgical
operations as a racemic mixture of its two optical isomers. The recent
availability of pure enantiomers of isoflurane has encouraged their
use in experimental studies, and stereoselective effects have now
been observed on anesthetic-sensitive neuronal ion channels. Although
it has been assumed that such chiral effects demonstrate direct interactions
with proteins, it is possible that they could be due to stereoselective
interactions with chiral membrane lipids. We have determined the
partition coefficients of the two optical isomers of isoflurane between
lipid bilayers and water, using racemic isoflurane and gas chromatography
with a chiral column. For lipid bilayers of phosphatidylcholine (PC)
and 4 mol{\%} phosphatidic acid (PA), both with and without cholesterol
(CHOL), we found equal partitioning of the isoflurane optical isomers.
The ratios of the S(+) to R(-) isoflurane partition coefficients
were (mean +/- SEM): 1.018 +/- 0.010 for bilayers of PC/CHOL/PA (mole
ratios 56:40:4) and 1.011 +/- 0.002 for bilayers of PC/PA (mole ratio
96:4). Molar partition coefficients for racemic isoflurane were 49
+/- 4 and 165 +/- 10, respectively. These findings support the view
that the stereoselective effects on ion channels observed with isoflurane
are due to direct actions on proteins rather than lipids.},

@article{Ramstedt.2006,
 abstract = {This review is focused on the formation of lateral domains in model bilayer membranes, with an emphasis on sphingolipids and their interaction with cholesterol. Sphingolipids in general show a preference for partitioning into ordered domains. One of the roles of cholesterol is apparently to modulate the fluidity of the sphingolipid domains and also to help segregate the domains for functional purposes. Cholesterol shows a preference for sphingomyelin over phosphatidylcholine with corresponding acyl chains. The interaction of cholesterol with different sphingolipids is largely dependent on the molecular properties of the particular sphingolipid in question. Small head group size clearly has a destabilizing effect on sphingolipid/cholesterol interaction, as exemplified by studies with ceramide and ceramide phosphoethanolamine. Ceramides actually displace sterol from ordered domains formed with saturated phosphatidylcholine or sphingomyelin. The N-linked acyl chain is known to be an important stabilizer of the sphingolipid/cholesterol interaction. However, N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines failed to interact favorably with cholesterol and to form cholesterol-enriched lateral domains in bilayer membranes. Glycosphingolipids also form ordered domains in membranes but do not show a strong preference for interacting with cholesterol. It is clear from the studies reviewed here that small changes in the structure of sphingolipids alter their partitioning between lateral domains substantially},

polarization of 2-, 6-, 12-(9-anthroyloxy) stearic acids and 16-(9-anthroyloxy)
palmitic acid. Ethylazinphos (50 and 100 {\^I}{\textonequarter}M) increases the fluorescence
polarization of the probes, either in the gel or in the fluid phase
of DPPC bilayers, and this concentration dependent effect decreases
from the surface to the bilayer core. Additionally, the insecticide
displaces the phase transition to a lower temperature range and broadens
the transition profile of DPPC. A shifting and broadening of the
phase transition is also observed by DSC. Furthermore at insecticide/lipid
molar ratios higher than 1/7, DSC thermograms, in addition to the
normal transition centered at 41{\^A}°C, also display a new phase transition
centered at 45.5{\^A}°C. The enthalpy of this new transition increases
with insecticide concentration, with a corresponding decrease of
the main transition enthalpy. Ethylazinphos in DPPC bilayers with
low cholesterol ({\^a}‰¤20 mol{\%}) perturbs the membrane organization as
described above for pure DPPC. However, cholesterol concentrations
higher than 20 mol{\%} prevent insecticide interaction, as revealed
by fluorescence polarization and DSC data. Apparently, cholesterol
significantly modulates insecticide interaction by competition for
similar distribution domains in the membrane. The present results
strongly support our previous hypothesis that ethylazinphos locates
in the cooperativity region, i.e. the region of C1{\^a}{\text\euro}{\grqq}C9 atoms of
the acyl chains, and extends to the lipid{\^a}{\text\euro}{\grqq}water interface, where
it increases lipid packing order sensed across all the thickness
of the bilayer. Additionally, and, on the basis of DSC data, a lateral
regionalization of ethylazinphos is here tentatively suggested.},

Membrane rafts of higher lipid chain order were proposed to mediate protein interactions, but have thus far not been directly observed. Here we use protein micropatterning combined with single-molecule tracking to put current models to the test: we rearranged lipid-anchored raft proteins (glycosylphosphatidylinositol(GPI)-anchored-mGFP) directly in the live cell plasma membrane and measured the effect on the local membrane environment. Intriguingly, this treatment does neither nucleate the formation of an ordered membrane phase nor result in any enrichment of nanoscopic-ordered domains within the micropatterned regions. In contrast, we find that immobilized mGFP-GPIs behave as inert obstacles to the diffusion of other membrane constituents without influencing their membrane environment over distances beyond their physical size.

PC-cholesterol interactions are well studied, far less is known about
those between PE and cholesterol. Here, we investigated the molecular
organization of cholesterol in PEs that vary in their degree of acyl
chain unsaturation. For heteroacid sn-1 saturated (palmitoyl), sn-2
unsaturated (various acyl chain) PIES, cholesterol solubility determined
by X-ray diffraction was essentially identical with 1 (oleoyl, 51
+/- 3 mol {\%}) and 2 (linoleoyl, 49 +/- 2 mol {\%}) double bonds before
decreasing progressively with 4 (arachidonyl, 41 +/- 3 mol {\%}) and
6 (docosahexaenoyl, 31 +/- 3 mol {\%}) double bonds. With 6 double
bonds in each chain, cholesterol solubility was further reduced to
8.5 +/- 1 mol {\%}. However, H-2 NMR experiments established that the
orientation of cholesterol in the same heteroacid PE membranes was
unaffected by the degree of acyl chain unsaturation. A tilt angle
of 15 +/- 1 degrees was measured when equimolar [3 alpha-H-2(1)]cholesterol
was added, regardless of the number of double bonds in the sn-2 chain.
The finding that solubility of cholesterol in sn-1 saturated PlEs
depends on the amount of polyunsaturation in the sn-2 chain of PE
differs from the equivalent PCs that universally incorporate similar
to 50 mol {\%} sterol. Unlike PCs, a differential in affinity for cholesterol

PEs. This distinction may have biological implications reflected
by the health benefits of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids that
are often taken up into PE > PC.},

Interestingly, many fluorescent lipid probes, including derivatives

that the covalent attachment of a small fluorophore to a lipid molecule

localization of one of the BODIPY-cholesterol derivatives was dependent
on the lipid composition of the bilayer. These data suggest that
conclusions about the identification of membrane domains in supported

be interpreted with caution. The combination of AFM with fluorescence

This approach compares the efficiency of energy transfer between
two matched fluorescent lipid donors, differing in their affinities
for ordered versus disordered regions of the bilayer, and an acceptor
lipid that distributes preferentially into disordered regions. Inhomogeneities
in bilayer organization, on spatial scales of tens of nanometers

Using a novel pair of 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl (NBD)-labeled
tetraacyl lipids as donor species with a rhodaminyl-labeled acceptor,
this strategy faithfully reports homo-versus inhomogeneous mixing
in each of several lipid bilayer systems whose organization on the
FRET distance scale can be predicted from previous findings. Interestingly,
however, the present FRET method reports clear evidence of inhomogeneity
in the organization of mixtures combining sphingomyelin or saturated

2, 2, 3, 4, 4, and 6, and proton-deuterium contrast techniques were
used to locate the position of the labeled part of the steroid in
the membrane. Cholesterol. is found well embedded in the membrane,with
ring A at 16.3 +/-;0.5 Angstrom from the bilayer center at 10 degreesC.
This location linearly decreases to 15.1 +/- 0.5 A at 50 degreesC,
demonstrating that the sterol is not expelled from the membrane on
crossing the former gel-to-fluid phase transition of pure DMPC (24
degreesC). Molecular dynamics were also performed on well-hydrated
membranes in the presence and absence of cholesterol. Neutron scattering
ID profiles were then calculated for comparison with experimental
neutron scattering data. The profile obtained from pure fluid-phase
lipids is in nice agreement both in shape and in bilayer hydrophobic
thickness with the experiment. The pure gel-phase calculation leads
to the correct line shape but with an overestimated bilayer thickness.
In the presence of cholesterol, only the calculation performed with
initial gel-phase conditions leads to a hydrophobic thickness in
agreement with neutron data. Ring A of cholesterol is found at 15.2
+/- 0.5 Angstrom at 10 degreesC, underestimating the experimental
value by only 1 Angstrom. Molecular dynamics show that the hydroxyl
group of cholesterol is hydrated and in such a proximity to the carboxyl
oxygens of the phospholipids that it can make hydrogen bonds. The
ability for molecular dynamics calculations on membranes to determine
structural data in membranes is finally discussed.},

specialists. Experimental C-13-H-1 and H-2 NMR segmental order parameters
(S-CH or S-CD) and spin-lattice (Zeeman) relaxation times (T-1Z)
are summarized in convenient tabular form for various saturated,
unsaturated, and biological membrane phospholipids. Segmental order
parameters give direct information about bilayer structural properties,
including the area per lipid and volumetric hydrocarbon thickness.
In addition, relaxation rates provide complementary information about
molecular dynamics. Particular attention is paid to the magnetic
field dependence (frequency dispersion) of the NMR relaxation rates
in terms of various simplified power laws. Model-free reduction of
the T-1Z studies in terms of a power-law formalism shows that the
relaxation rates for saturated phosphatidylcholines follow a single
frequency-dispersive trend within the MHz regime. We show how analytical
models can guide the continued development of atomistic and coarse-grained
force fields. Our interpretation suggests that lipid diffusion and
collective order fluctuations are implicitly governed by the viscoelastic
nature of the liquid-crystalline ensemble. Collective bilayer excitations
are emergent over mesoscopic length scales that fall between the
molecular and bilayer dimensions, and are important for lipid organization
and lipid-protein interactions. Future conceptual advances and theoretical
reductions will foster understanding of biomembrane structural dynamics

The temperature dependence of the first moment of the (2)H spectrum of the sample made with DPPC-d62 and of the quadrupolar splittings of the chain-methyl-labeled DPPC-d6 sample are directly related to the temperature dependence of the critical order parameter \textgreek{h}, which scales as [Formula: see text] near the critical temperature. Analysis of the data reveals that for the chain perdeuterated sample, the value of Tc is 301.51 $\pm$ 0.1 K, and that of the critical exponent, \textgreek{b}c~= 0.391 $\pm$ 0.02. The line shape analysis of the methyl labeled (d6) sample gives Tc~= 303.74 $\pm$ 0.07 K and \textgreek{b}c~= 0.338 $\pm$ 0.009. These values obtained for \textgreek{b}c are in good agreement with the predictions of a three-dimensional Ising model. The difference in critical temperature between the two samples having nominally the same molar composition arises because of the lowering of the phase transition temperature that occurs due to the perdeuteration of the DPPC.},

 abstract = {Determination of the depth of radical penetration into a lipid membrane
is critical to the understanding of the role membranes play in radical
attack. We have previously studied radical penetration into lipid
bilayers using novel lipophilic spin traps and a combination of NMR
and ESR techniques. We now focus on erythrocyte ghost (EG) membranes.
Based on a correlation between ESR {\^I}$^2$-H splitting constants (a{\^I}$^2$-H)
and solvent polarity, we have been able to locate stable radicals
such as doxyls 2{\^a}{\text\euro}{\grqq}4 and spin adducts 6{\^a}{\text\euro}{\grqq}8 intercalated within liposomal
bilayers and EG membranes. As a rule, the more lipophilic a spin
adduct, the deeper it is found in the bilayer; however, the depth
of penetration also depends on the steric bulk of the intercalant
and whether intercalation is effected by sonication or diffusion,
with the former more energetic and more effective. Compared to simple
liposomes, the head group region of the red blood cell membrane is
more rigid and lipophilic because of the presence of cholesterol.
Hence, the biomembrane head group filters out possible intercalants
that are not sufficiently lipophilic. Steric bulk plays less of a
role in the EG system, perhaps because the cholesterol introduces
a greater element of disorder, attenuating the role played by lipid{\^a}{\text\euro}{\grqq}lipid

 abstract = {We have studied the effects of cholesterol and steroid-based antibiotic
fusidic acid (FA) on the behavior of lipid bilayers using a variety
of experimental techniques together with atomic-scale molecular dynamics
simulations. Capillary electrophoretic measurements showed that FA
was incorporated into fluid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
membranes. Differential scanning calorimetry in turn showed that
FA only slightly altered the thermodynamic properties of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DPPC) bilayers, whereas cholesterol abolished all endotherms when
the mole fraction of cholesterol (X-chol) was > 0.20. Fluorescence
spectroscopy was then used to further characterize the influence
of these two steroids on DPPC large unilamellar vesicles. In the
case of FA, our result strongly suggested that FA was organized into
lateral microdomains with increased water penetration into the membrane.
For cholesterol/DPPC mixtures, fluorescence spectroscopy results
were compatible with the formation of the liquid-ordered phase. A
comparison of FA and cholesterol-induced effects on DPPC bilayers
through atomistic molecular dynamics simulations showed that both
FA and cholesterol tend to order neighboring lipid chains. However,
the ordering effect of FA was slightly weaker than that of cholesterol,
and especially for deprotonated FA the difference was significant.
Summarizing, our results show that FA is readily incorporated into
the lipid bilayer where it is likely to be enriched into lateral
microdomains. These domains could facilitate the association of elongation
actor-G into lipid rafts in living bacteria, enhancing markedly the
antibiotic efficacy of FA.},

These model mixtures include cholesterol, together with one high-melting lipid and one low-melting lipid. An interesting finding is of two categories of such 3-component mixtures, leading to what we term Type I and Type II compositional phase diagrams. The latter have phase regions of macroscopic coexisting domains of [Lalpha+Lbeta+Lo] and of [Lalpha+Lo], with domains resolved under the light microscope. Type I mixtures have the same phase coexistence regions, but the domains seem to be nanoscopic. Type I mixtures are likely to be better models for biological membranes},

@article{Gawrisch.1996,
 abstract = {A delicate balance of attractive and repulsive forces between lipid
molecules determines the average area per lipid in the liquid crystalline
lamellar phase. Formation of inverted non-lamellar phases is linked
to an imbalance in lateral tension between lipid headgroups and chains
favoring formation of curved lipid monolayers, such as in Inverse
hexagonal (H-II) and cubic phases. If assembled in bilayers, non-lamellar
forming lipids are under a curvature related lateral stress. This
tension imbalance influences molecular cross-sectional area in the
lamellar phase which is reflected in order parameter changes of a
perdeuterated lipid chain. H-2 NMR order parameters are sensitive
to variations as small as 0.2 Angstrom(2) in area per molecule. Curvature
stress caused by a reduction of repulsive forces between headgroups,
e.g. replacement of PC with PE raises chain order and reduces area
per lipid by a few square angstrom. Stress caused by increased repulsive
tension between lipid hydrocarbon chains, e.g. an increase in chain
length, chain unsaturation or a rise in temperature, lowers chain
order and increases area per molecule. Addition of alkanes, alcohols,
cholesterol and other substances also changes lipid order, but interpretation
of these changes in terms of tension in headgroup and chain regions
does not follow simple patterns. In addition to altering tension,
these additives may stabilize non-lamellar phases by lowering interstitial
energies.},

For this purpose Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to obtain pressure P and positional fluctuations sigma. An alternative method, called Fourier Monte Carlo (FMC), that is based on a Fourier representation of the displacement field, is developed and its superiority over the standard method is demonstrated. The FMC method is applied to simulating a single membrane between two hard walls, which models a stack of lipid bilayer membranes with nonharmonic interactions. Finite-size scaling is demonstrated and used to obtain accurate values for P and sigma in the limit of a large continuous membrane. The results are compared with perturbation theory approximations, and numerical differences are found in the nonharmonic case. Therefore the FMC method, rather than the approximations, should be used for establishing the connection between model potentials and observable quantities, as well as for pure modeling purposes},

 abstract = {Ternary phase diagrams have been shown to be very useful in understanding
the phenomena of lipid rafts. Recently a comprehensive ternary phase
diagram for DPPC-d(62)/DOPC/Chol using static (2)H-NMR has been reported
[ S. L. Veatch, O. Soubias, S. L. Keller, and K. Gawrisch Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,
2007, 104, 17650-17655]. However, it is often difficult to interpret
these ternary phase diagrams as there are many possible ambiguities,
in particular, the extent of the gel(s(o))-L(o)-L(alpha)(1(d)) three
phase region and the clear demarcation between the gel(s(o)) and
L(o) phase. Here we examine the canonical model lipid raft system
by a multinuclear approach using (2)H static and (13)C, (31)P Magic
Angle Spinning (MAS) NMR. By using deuterated DPPC (DPPC-d(62)) it
is possible to examine changes in the methylene chain order parameters
of the saturated lipid whilst changing the ratio of saturated to
unsaturated phospholipid. From these data it is possible to propose
the existence at low temperatures (<20 degrees C) of a disrupted
or disordered gel-type phase at ratios as high as 1:1:1 DOPC/DPPC/Chol,
in equilibrium with fluid phases. The presence of a gel-type phase
was also confirmed by (13)C and (31)P MAS NMR. This disrupted gel-type
phase has different properties in terms of axial rotation than that
of the liquid ordered phase (L(o)). We have also shown that it is
possible to observe different quadrupolar splittings for the inequivalent
sn-1 and sn-2 methyl groups in a gel phase. We have concluded that
this is not always indicative of a liquid-ordered lamellar L(o) phase,
as previously assumed. Above the melting point of the gel-type phase
(similar to 20 degrees C), we observe a single fluid environment
for both DPPC-d(62) and Chol-d(1) on the basis of the (2)H-NMR spectra,
which are an average of a fluid disordered (L alpha) and an Lo phase.
In this fluid regime, the order parameters for the 1:1:1 system DPPC-d(62)/DOPC/Chol
are close to that of the binary (1:1) DPPC-d(62): Chol system, indicating
non-random distribution of the DPPC-d(62). Increasing the ratio of
DOPC to DPPC, from 1:1:1 to 1.5:1:1 to 2:1:1 in the ternary system,
causes an increase in chain length of the DPPC-d(62) in the fluid
phase.},

The unlike nearest-neighbor interaction free energies (omega(AB)) between lipids (including Chol), obtained by an variety of unrelated methods, are typically in the range of 0-400 cal/mol in absolute value. Most are positive, meaning that the interaction is unfavorable, but some are negative, meaning it is favorable.

 abstract = {Single molecule fluorescence measurements have recently been used
to probe the orientation of fluorescent lipid analogs doped into
lipid films at trace levels. Using defocused polarized total internal
reflection fluorescence microscopy (PTIRF-M), these studies have
shown that fluorophore orientation responds to changes in membrane
surface pressure and composition, providing a molecular level marker
of membrane structure. Here we extend those studies by characterizing
the single molecule orientations of six related BODIPY probes doped
into monolayers of DPPC. Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers transferred
at various surface pressures are used to compare the response from
fluorescent lipid analogs in which the location of the BODIPY probe
is varied along the length of the acyl chain. For each BODIPY probe
location along the chain, comparisons are made between analogs containing
phosphocholine and smaller fatty acid headgroups. Together these
studies show a general propensity of the BODIPY analogs to insert
into membranes with the BODIPY probe aligned along the acyl chains
or looped back to interact with the headgroups. For all BODIPY probes
studied, a bimodal orientation distribution is observed which is
sensitive to surface pressure, with the population of BODIPY probes
aligned along the acyl chains increasing with elevated surface pressure.
Trends in the single molecule orientations for the six analogs reveal
a configuration where optimal placement of the BODIPY probe within
the acyl chain maximizes its sensitivity to the surrounding membrane
structure. These results are discussed in terms of balancing the
effects of headgroup association with acyl chain length in designing
the optimal placement of the BODIPY probe.},

 abstract = {The effect of an oxidized form of cholesterol, 3 beta-hydroxy-5-oxo-5,6-secocholestan-6-al
on the thermotropic and structural properties of phospholipid membranes
was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction
and compared with that of cholesterol. The phospholipids studied
included 1palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylserine, dipalmitoleoylphosphatidylethanolamine,
1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, dipalmitoleoylphosphatidylcholine,
1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine. Depending on the constituent
phospholipids, the oxidized cholesterol is observed to shift phase
transitions, disrupt stacking, modify interbilayer spacings and promote
increased negative membrane curvature. We determined by absorption
spectroscopy that the amino group of phosphatidylserine forms a Schiff
base with the aldehyde group of the 3 beta-hydroxy-5oxo-5,6-secocholestan-6-al
as was previously found for the amino group of phosphatidylethanolamine.
This result strengthens the biologically significant finding that
not only amino groups of proteins but also amino groups of phospholipids
are able to form a Schiff base with oxidized cholesterol. The marked
triangular shape of the Schiff base complex with phosphatidylethanolamine
may explain how 3 beta-hydroxy-5-oxo-5,6-secocholestan-6-al can promote
increased negative curvature in the hexagonal phase, as compared
to cholesterol, even though its increased polarity would favor a
location closer to the interface with water. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland

when attached to a lipid acyl chain rather than embedding deeply
into the bilayer. To achieve maximum embedding of BODIPY (4,4-difluoro-4bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene)
fluorophore into the bilayer apolar region, a series of sn-2 acyl-labeled
phosphatidylcholines was synthesized bearing 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl4-bora-3a,
4a-diaza-s-indacene-8-yl (Me4-BODIPY-8) at the end of C3-, C5-, C7-,
or C9-acyl. A strategy was used of symmetrically dispersing the methyl
groups at BODIPY ring positions 1, 3, 5, and 7 to decrease fluorophore
polarity. Iodide quenching of the phosphatidylcholine probes in bilayer
vesicles confirmed that the Me4-BODIPY-8 fluorophore was embedded
in the bilayer. Parallax analysis of Me4-BODIPY-8 fluorescence quenching
by phosphatidylcholines containing iodide at different positions
along the sn-2 acyl chain indicated that the penetration depth of
Me-4-BODIPY-8 into the bilayer was determined by the length of the
linking acyl chain. Evaluation using monolayers showed minimal perturbation
of < 10 mol{\%} probe in fluid-phase and cholesterol-enriched phosphatidylcholine.
Spectral characterization in monolayers and bilayers confirmed the
retention of many features of other BODIPY derivatives (i.e., absorption
and emission wavelength maxima near 498 nm and similar to 506 - 515
nm) but also showed the absence of the 620 630 nm peak associated
with BODIPY dimer fluorescence and the presence of a 570 nm emission
shoulder at high Me-4-BODIPY-8 surface concentrations. We conclude
that the new probes should have versatile utility in membrane studies,
especially when precise location of the reporter group is needed.},

@article{Bruckner.2009,
 abstract = {Cellular and organellar membranes are dynamic materials that underlie
many aspects of cell biology. Biological membranes have long been
thought of as elastic materials with respect to bending deformations.
A wealth of theory and experimentation on pure phospholipid membranes
provides abundant support for this idea. However, biological membranes
are not composed solely of phospholipids-they also incorporate a
variety of amphiphilic molecules that undergo rapid transbilayer
flip-flop. Here we describe several experimental systems that demonstrate
deformation-induced molecular flip-flop. First we use a fluorescence
assay to track osmotically controlled membrane deformation in single
component fatty acid vesicles, and show that the relaxation of the
induced bending stress is mediated by fatty acid flip-flop. We then
look at two-component phospholipid/cholesterol composite vesicles.
We use NMR to show that the steady-state rate of interleaflet diffusion
of cholesterol is fast relative to biological membrane remodeling.
We then use a Forster resonance energy transfer assay to detect the
transbilayer movement of cholesterol upon deformation. We suggest
that our results can be interpreted by modifying the area difference
elasticity model to account for the time-dependent relaxation of
bending energy. Our findings suggest that rapid interleaflet diffusion
of cholesterol may play a role in membrane remodeling in vivo. We
suggest that the molecular characteristics of sterols make them evolutionarily
preferred mediators of stress relaxation, and that the universal
presence of sterols in the membranes of eukaryotes, even at low concentrations,
reflects the importance of membrane remodeling in eukaryotic cells.},

Some conventional sample preparation methods pass the lipid mixture through an intermediary, solvent-free state. This is an ordered, solid state and may favor the demixing of membrane components. A new preparative method has been developed which is specifically designed to avoid this intermediary state. This novel strategy is called rapid solvent exchange (RSE) and entails the direct transfer of lipid mixtures between organic solvent and aqueous buffer. RSE liposomes require no more than a minute to prepare and manifest considerable entrapment volumes with a high fraction of external surface area. In phospholipid/cholesterol mixtures of high cholesterol content, suspensions prepared by more conventional methods reveal evidence of artifactual demixing, whereas samples prepared by rapid solvent exchange do not. The principles which may lead to artifactual demixing during conventional sample preparation are discussed},

size of phospholipid (PL) headgroups is increased and where the freedom
of motion (inverse order) of fatty acid chains is incremented. Increasing
the PL headgroup cross-sectional area, from that of N-meth-DOPE to
that of DOPC (an increase from ca. 60 to 70 {\"i}?`{\textonehalf}?2), is associated
with a doubling of the channel mean opentime. Channel conductance,
however, was unaffected. Increasing the order of the fatty acid chains,
from that of DOPE to POPE and to that of DEPE, had no significant
effect on channel properties (at 22{\^A}°C). We interpret the changes
reported here to reflect lipid-protein interactions through the induction
of structural stress related to the headgroup structures of phospholipids.},

Parameters of vesicle populations and internal structure of the DMPC bilayer were characterized on the basis of the separated form factor (SFF) model. Vesicle shape changes from nearly spherical in the Lalpha phase to elliptical in the Pbeta' and Lbeta' phases. This is true for vesicles prepared via extrusion through pores with the diameter 500 A. Parameters of the internal bilayer structure (thickness of the membrane and the hydrophobic core, hydration and the surface area of the lipid molecule) were determined on the basis of the hydrophobic-hydrophilic (HH) approximation of neutron scattering length density across the bilayer rhox and of the step function (SF) approximation of rhox. DMPC membrane thickness in the Lalpha phase (T = 30 degrees C) demonstrates a dependence on the membrane curvature for extruded vesicles. Prepared via extrusion through 500 A diameter pores, vesicle population in the Lalpha phase has the following characteristics: average value of minor semi-axis 266 +/- 2 A, ellipse eccentricity 1.11 +/- 0.02, polydispersity 26{\%}, thickness of the membrane 48.9 +/- 0.2 A and of the hydrophobic core 19.9 +/- 0.4 A, surface area 60.7 +/- 0.5 A2 and number of water molecules 12.8 +/- 0.3 per DMPC molecule. Vesicles prepared via extrusion through pores with the diameter 1,000 A have polydispersity of 48{\%} and membrane thickness of 45.5 +/- 0.6 A in the Lalpha phase. SF approximation was used to describe the DMPC membrane structure in Lbeta' (T = 10 degrees C) and Pbeta' (T = 20 degrees C) phases. Extruded DMPC vesicles in D2O have membrane thickness of 49.6 +/- 0.5 A in the Lbeta' phase and 48.3 +/- 0.6 A in the Pbeta' phase. The dependence of the DMPC membrane thickness on temperature was restored from the SANS experiment.},

Spontaneous curvatures of bilayer forming lipids were estimated by adding controlled amounts to a HII forming template following previously established protocols. Spontaneous curvatures of both phosphatidylethanolamines and cholesterol were found to be at least a factor of two more negative than those of phosphatidylcholines, whose J 0 values are closer to zero. Interestingly, a significant positive J 0 value was retrieved for DPPC. We further determined the temperature dependence of the spontaneous curvatures J 0(T) in the range from 15 to 55 °C, resulting in a quite narrow distribution of -1 to -3 $\times$ 10(-3) (nm °C)(-1) for most investigated lipids. The data allowed us to estimate the monolayer spontaneous curvatures of ternary lipid mixtures showing liquid ordered/liquid disordered phase coexistence.

 abstract = {{\dq}Lipid raft{\dq} is the name given to the tiny, dynamic, and ordered domains of cholesterol and sphingolipids that are hypothesized to exist in the plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells. According to the lipid raft hypothesis, these cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched domains modulate the protein-protein interactions that are essential for cellular function. Indeed, many studies have shown that cellular levels of cholesterol and sphingolipids influence plasma membrane organization, cell signaling, and other important biological processes. Despite 15 years of research and the application of highly advanced imaging techniques, data that unambiguously demonstrate the existence of lipid rafts in mammalian cells are still lacking. This Perspective summarizes the results that challenge the lipid raft hypothesis and discusses alternative hypothetical models of plasma membrane organization and lipid-mediated cellular function},

 abstract = {Quantitative structures were obtained for the fully hydrated fluid phases of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers by simultaneously analyzing x-ray and neutron scattering data. The neutron data for DOPC included two solvent contrasts, 50{\%} and 100{\%} D(2)O. For DPPC, additional contrast data were obtained with deuterated analogs DPPC{\_}d62, DPPC{\_}d13, and DPPC{\_}d9. For the analysis, we developed a model that is based on volume probability distributions and their spatial conservation. The model's design was guided and tested by a DOPC molecular dynamics simulation. The model consistently captures the salient features found in both electron and neutron scattering density profiles. A key result of the analysis is the molecular surface area, A. For DPPC at 50 degrees C A = 63.0 A(2), whereas for DOPC at 30 degrees C A = 67.4 A(2), with estimated uncertainties of 1 A(2). Although A for DPPC agrees with a recently reported value obtained solely from the analysis of x-ray scattering data, A for DOPC is almost 10{\%} smaller. This improved method for determining lipid areas helps to reconcile long-standing differences in the values of lipid areas obtained from stand-alone x-ray and neutron scattering experiments and poses new challenges for molecular dynamics simulations},

High-resolution x-ray scattering data were analyzed in conjunction with contrast-varied neutron scattering data using a technique we recently developed. Analyses of the data show that the manner by which bilayer thickness increases with increasing n in monounsaturated diacylphosphatidylcholines is dependent on the double bond's position. For commonly available monounsaturated diacylphosphatidylcholines, this results in the nonlinear behavior of both bilayer thickness and lipid area, whereas for diC18:1PC bilayers, lipid area assumes a maximum value. It is worthwhile to note that compared to previous data, our results indicate that lipid areas are smaller by approximately 10{\%}. This observation highlights the need to revisit lipid areas, as they are often used in comparisons with molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, simulators are encouraged to compare their results not only to x-ray scattering data, but to neutron data as well.},

Bilayer parameters, such as area per lipid and overall bilayer thickness have been obtained in conjunction with intrabilayer structural parameters (e.g. hydrocarbon region thickness). The results have allowed us to assess the effect of temperature and hydrocarbon chain composition on bilayer structure. For example, we found that for all lipids there is, not surprisingly, an increase in fatty acid chain trans-gauche isomerization with increasing temperature. Moreover, this increase in trans-gauche isomerization scales with fatty acid chain length in mixed chain lipids. However, in the case of lipids with saturated fatty acid chains, trans-gauche isomerization is increasingly tempered by attractive chain-chain van der Waals interactions with increasing chain length. Finally, our results confirm a strong dependence of lipid chain dynamics as a function of double bond position along fatty acid chains},

 abstract = {Following our previous efforts in determining the structures of commonly used PC, PG, and PS bilayers, we continue our studies of fully hydrated, fluid phase PE bilayers. The newly designed parsing scheme for PE bilayers was based on extensive MD simulations, and is utilized in the SDP analysis of both X-ray and neutron (contrast varied) scattering measurements. Obtained experimental scattering form factors are directly compared to our simulation results, and can serve as a benchmark for future developed force fields. Among the evaluated structural parameters, namely, area per lipid A, overall bilayer thickness DB, and hydrocarbon region thickness 2DC, the PE bilayer response to changing temperature is similar to previously studied bilayers with different headgroups. On the other hand, the reduced hydration of PE headgroups, as well as the strong hydrogen bonding between PE headgroups, dramatically affects lateral packing within the bilayer. Despite sharing the same glycerol backbone, a markedly smaller area per lipid distinguishes PE from other bilayers (i.e., PC, PG, and PS) studied to date. Overall, our data are consistent with the notion that lipid headgroups govern bilayer packing, while hydrocarbon chains dominate the bilayer's response to temperature changes.},

However, because the new data have been obtained in a variety of research contexts using various biological paradigms, the impact of the critical conceptual modifications on biomedical research and development has been limited. In this review, we try to synthesize our current biological, chemical, and physical knowledge about the plasma membrane to provide new fundamental organizing principles of this structure that underlie every molecular mechanism that realizes its functions. Special attention is paid to signal transduction function and the dynamic aspect of the organizing principles. We propose that the cooperative action of the hierarchical three-tiered mesoscale (2-300 nm) domains--actin-membrane-skeleton induced compartments (40-300 nm), raft domains (2-20 nm), and dynamic protein complex domains (3-10 nm)--is critical for membrane function and distinguishes the plasma membrane from a classical Singer-Nicolson-type model.},

@article{Kuzmin.2005,
 abstract = {Membrane domains known as rafts are rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, and are thought to be thicker than the surrounding membrane. If so, monolayers should elastically deform so as to avoid exposure of hydrophobic surfaces to water at the raft boundary. We calculated the energy of splay and tilt deformations necessary to avoid such hydrophobic exposure. The derived value of energy per unit length, the line tension gamma, depends on the elastic moduli of the raft and the surrounding membrane; it increases quadratically with the initial difference in thickness between the raft and surround; and it is reduced by differences, either positive or negative, in spontaneous curvature between the two. For zero spontaneous curvature, gamma is approximately 1 pN for a monolayer height mismatch of approximately 0.3 nm, in agreement with experimental measurement. Our model reveals conditions that could prevent rafts from forming, and a mechanism that can cause rafts to remain small. Prevention of raft formation is based on our finding that the calculated line tension is negative if the difference in spontaneous curvature for a raft and the surround is sufficiently large: rafts cannot form if gamma < 0 unless molecular interactions (ignored in the model) are strong enough to make the total line tension positive. Control of size is based on our finding that the height profile from raft to surround does not decrease monotonically, but rather exhibits a damped, oscillatory behavior. As an important consequence, the calculated energy of interaction between rafts also oscillates as it decreases with distance of separation, creating energy barriers between closely apposed rafts. The height of the primary barrier is a complex function of the spontaneous curvatures of the raft and the surround. This barrier can kinetically stabilize the rafts against merger. Our physical theory thus quantifies conditions that allow rafts to form, and further, defines the parameters that control raft merger},

 abstract = {lt has been shown that the partitioning of vinblastine in 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine
(DPPC) single and multiple bilayer dispersions induces partial interdigitation
of the lipid alkyl chains. Similar behavior has been observed for
abietic and ursodeoxycholic acids and may well be generalized for
the partitioning of bulky amphoteric molecules, which tend to localize
in the vicinity of the polar heads. For the present study, differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been employed to investigate the role
of lipid molecular characteristics such as the alkyl chain length
and the polarity of the head-group, as well as the impact of cholesterol
upon vinblastine-induced interdigitation. It is found that vinblastine
does not induce interdigitation in lipids with either shorter or
longer alkyl chains than DPPC, or having head-groups of different
polarity. In addition, it is shown that the presence of cholesterol
in the lipid bilayer tends to modulate the phase behavior of the
lipid/vinblastine bilayer system. Preliminary studies show that such
properties directly affect the encapsulation efficiency and the pharmacokinetics
of liposomes. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {The free energy difference associated with the transfer of a single
cholesterol molecule from the aqueous phase into a lipid bilayer
depends on its final location, namely on its insertion depth and
orientation within the bilayer. We calculated desolvation and lipid
bilayer perturbation contributions to the water-to-membrane transfer
free energy, thus allowing us to determine the most favorable location
of cholesterol in the membrane and the extent of fluctuations around
it. The electrostatic and nonpolar contributions to the solvation
free energy were calculated using continuum solvent models. Lipid
layer perturbations, resulting from both conformational restrictions
of the lipid chains in the vicinity of the (rigid) cholesterol backbone
and from cholesterol-induced elastic deformations, were calculated
using a simple director model and elasticity theory, respectively.
As expected from the amphipathic nature of cholesterol and in agreement
with the available experimental data, our results show that at the
energetically favorable state, cholesterol's hydrophobic core is
buried within the hydrocarbon region of the bilayer. At this state,
cholesterol spans approximately one leaflet of the membrane, with
its OH group protruding into the polar (headgroup) region of the
bilayer, thus avoiding an electrostatic desolvation penalty. We found
that the transfer of cholesterol into a membrane is mainly driven
by the favorable nonpolar contributions to the solvation free energy,
whereas only a small opposing contribution is caused by conformational
restrictions of the lipid chains. Our calculations also predict a
strong tendency of the lipid layer to elastically respond to (thermally
excited) vertical fluctuations of cholesterol so as to fully match
the hydrophobic height of the solute. However, orientational fluctuations
of cholesterol were found to be accompanied by both an elastic adjustment
of the surrounding lipids and by a partial exposure of the hydrophobic
cholesterol backbone to the polar (headgroup) environment. Our calculations
of the molecular order parameter, which reflects the extent of orientational
fluctuations of cholesterol in the membrane, are in good agreement
with available experimental data.},

 abstract = {Oxidative modification of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and their
unrestricted scavenger receptor-dependent uptake is believed to account
for cholesterol deposition in macrophage-derived foam cells. It has
been suggested that vitamin E that is transported by LDL plays a
critical role in protecting against LDL oxidation. We hypothesize
that the maintenance of sufficiently high vitamin E concentrations
in LDL can be achieved by reducing its chromanoxyl radicals, i.e.,
by vitamin E recycling. In this study we demonstrate that: i) chromanoxyl
radicals of endogenous vitamin E and of exogenously added alpha-tocotrienol,
alpha-tocopherol or its synthetic homologue with a 6-carbon side-chain,
chromanol-alpha-C6, can be directly generated in human LDL by ultraviolet
(UV) light, or by interaction with peroxyl radicals produced either
by an enzymic oxidation system (lipoxygenase + linolenic acid) or
by an azo-initiator, 2,2'-azo-bis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) (AMVN);
ii) ascorbate can recycle endogenous vitamin E and exogenously added
chromanols by direct reduction of chromanoxyl radicals in LDL; iii)
dihydrolipoic acid is not efficient in direct reduction of chromanoxyl
radicals but recycles vitamin E by synergistically interacting with
ascorbate (reduces dehydroascorbate thus maintaining the steady-state
concentration of ascorbate); and iv) beta-carotene is not active
in vitamin E recycling but may itself be protected against oxidative
destruction by the reductants of chromanoxyl radicals. We suggest
that the recycling of vitamin E and other phenolic antioxidants by
plasma reductants may be an important mechanism for the enhanced
antioxidant protection of LDL.},

accepted that the lipid bilayer is the underlying structure of most,
if not all, biomembranes. As such, over the years scientists have
exerted much effort in studying lipid bilayers and their biological
relevance in hopes of understanding the functional mechanisms taking
place at membrane interfaces. Neutron and X-ray scattering techniques
are powerful tools for the characterization of the structure and
dynamics of biomimetic systems as they provide unique access to microscopic
structure and dynamics at length scales ranging from microns to intermolecular
and/or atomic distances. The optimization of instruments and preparation
techniques, as well as the new possibilities offered by protein deuteration,
have opened up new avenues for the study of lipid/protein interactions
that were not previously possible. One can now look at the insertion
of biomolecules into membranes and accurately determine the structure
as well as the dynamics of the interaction. To illustrate the usefulness
of diffraction and scattering techniques with regard to biologically
relevant systems, we review some of the leading edge studies that

 abstract = {The highly successful scattering density profile (SDP) model, used to jointly analyze small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering data from unilamellar vesicles, has been adapted for use with data from fully hydrated, liquid crystalline multilamellar vesicles (MLVs). Using a genetic algorithm, this new method is capable of providing high-resolution structural information, as well as determining bilayer elastic bending fluctuations from standalone X-ray data. Structural parameters such as bilayer thickness and area per lipid were determined for a series of saturated and unsaturated lipids, as well as binary mixtures with cholesterol. The results are in good agreement with previously reported SDP data, which used both neutron and X-ray data. The inclusion of deuterated and non-deuterated MLV neutron data in the analysis improved the lipid backbone information but did not improve, within experimental error, the structural data regarding bilayer thickness and area per lipid.},

 abstract = {Biophysical understanding of membrane domains requires accurate knowledge of their structural details and elasticity. We report on a global small angle x-ray scattering data analysis technique for coexisting liquid-ordered (Lo) and liquid-disordered (Ld) domains in fully hydrated multilamellar vesicles. This enabled their detailed analysis for differences in membrane thickness, area per lipid, hydrocarbon chain length, and bending fluctuation as demonstrated for two ternary mixtures (DOPC/DSPC/CHOL and DOPC/DPPC/CHOL) at different cholesterol concentrations. Lo domains were found to be $\sim$10~{\AA} thicker, and laterally up to 20~{\AA}(2)/lipid more condensed than Ld domains. Their bending fluctuations were also reduced by $\sim$65{\%}. Increase of cholesterol concentration caused significant changes in structural properties of Ld, while its influence on Lo properties was marginal. We further observed that temperature-induced melting of Lo domains is associated with a diffusion of cholesterol to Ld domains and controlled by Lo/Ld thickness differences.},

@article{Hsueh.2010,
 abstract = {We study the effect of ergosterol on the physical properties of 1-[H-2(31)]palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine
(POPE) multibilayers using deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance.
NMR spectra were taken as a function of temperature and ergosterol
concentration up to 70 mol {\%}. The spectral first moments show that
there is a dramatic difference in the ability of ergosterol to disorder
the gel phase and to order the liquid-crystalline phase of POPE membranes,
an unusual behavior among lipid/sterol systems studied up to now.
Further investigation of the liquid-crystalline phase shows that
ergosterol (erg) increases the chain order of POPE-d31, but that
this effect saturates at 10 mol {\%} ergosterol. This is in marked
contrast to the effect of cholesterol (chol) on POPE membranes: the
chain order of POPE increases with cholesterol to at least 45 mol
{\%}. Moreover, we found that at higher ergosterol concentrations (>40
mol {\%}) ergosterol decreases the POPE-d31 chain order, which, to
our knowledge, has not been directly observed in other lipid/sterol
systems. The temperature-composition phase diagram is presented.
Finally, at all ergosterol concentrations, the chain order of liquid-crystalline-phase
POPE is much smaller than that of comparable POPE/chol membranes.
This implies that there is no liquid-ordered phase behavior for POPE/erg
membranes.},

@article{Huster.1998,
 abstract = {We investigated lateral lipid organization in membranes with a lipid
composition relevant to neural and retinal membranes [phosphatidylcholine
(PC)/phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)/phosphatidylserine (PS)/cholesterol,
4/4/1/1, mol/mol/mol/mol]. The mixed-chain phospholipids contained
saturated stearic acid (18:0) in the sn-1 position and the monounsaturated
oleic acid (18:1) or polyunsaturated docosahexaenoic acid (22:6)
in sn-2. Lateral lipid organization was evaluated by 2H NMR order
parameter measurements on stearic acid of all individual types of
phospholipids in the mixture and, through a novel approach, two-dimensional
NOESY 1H NMR spectroscopy with magic angle spinning (MAS). The docosahexaenoic
acid chain order was evaluated from 1H NMR chain signal MAS-sideband
intensities. Averaged over all lipids, the cholesterol-induced increase
in sn-1 chain order is 2-fold larger in monounsaturated than in polyunsaturated
lipids, and the order of both saturated and polyunsaturated hydrocarbon
chains increases. Addition of cholesterol increases lipid order in
the sequence 18:0-18:1 PE > 18:0-18:1 PC > 18:0-18:1 PS for the monounsaturated
and 18:0-22:6 PC {\^a}‰{\flqq} 18:0-22:6 PE > 18:0-22:6 PS for polyunsaturated
mixtures. The variation of order parameters between lipid species
suggests that cholesterol induces the formation of lipid microdomains
with a headgroup and chain unsaturation-dependent lipid composition.
The preferential interaction between cholesterol and polyunsaturated
18:0-22:6 PC, followed by 18:0-22:6 PE and 18:0-22:6 PS, was confirmed
by 1H MAS NOESY cross-relaxation rate differences. Furthermore, cholesterol
preferentially associates with saturated chains in mixed-chain lipids
reflected by higher saturated chain-to-cholesterol cross-relaxation
rates. We propose that cholesterol forms PC-enriched microdomains
in the polyunsaturated 18:0-22:6 PC/18:0-22:6 PE/18:0-22:6 PS/cholesterol
membranes in which the saturated sn-1 chains are preferentially oriented
toward the cholesterol molecules.},

@article{Jeu.2003,
 abstract = {Smectic membranes are perfect model systems for studying low-dimensional phase transitions and theassociated fluctuations. During the last two decades we have seen important progress in the understanding of the structure and fluctuation behavior of these systems, driven by both new experimental techniques and theoretical developments. Phase transitions are reviewed involving liquid, hexatic, and crystalline layers, which provide several types of model system for low-dimensional melting. The authors discuss the influence of the surfaces on the physical properties of the membranes as well as the crossover from three- to two-dimensional behavior. The layer-displacement fluctuations in smectic membranes have been investigated by specular and diffuse x-ray reflectivity. Theoretical and experimental aspects of the displacement-displacement correlation function are discussed. Of special interest is the quenching or enhancement of fluctuations at surfaces, which is directly related to the phenomenon of surface ordering. The authors consider the conditions under which fluctuations are conformal throughout a membrane, and then the dynamic aspects of the layer-displacement correlation function, which include the effects of finite size, surface tension, and viscous dissipation. This leads in smectic membranes to a discrete spectrum of elastic and viscous relaxation modes, which have been studied experimentally with coherent x rays at third-generation synchrotron sources. The fluctuating character of crystalline-B membranes is also considered. Finally, the article looks briefly at thinning transitions, smectic membranes of chiral molecules, smectic films on substrates, and applications to biologically relevant systems. Open questions and future trends in the field are discussed},
